                    Donkey Kong[a] is a video game series created by Shigeru Miyamoto. It follows the adventures of an ape named Donkey Kong
                    and his clan of other apes and monkeys. The franchise primarily consists of platform games, originally single-screen
                    action puzzle games and later side-scrolling platformers. The first game was the 1981 arcade game Donkey Kong, featuring
                    the homonymous character as the main antagonist in an industrial construction setting and the debut of both the Donkey
                    Kong and Mario characters. The title was a massive success and was followed by two sequels released in 1982 and 1983.
